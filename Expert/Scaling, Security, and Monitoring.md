# Goal: Master Redis for production-grade systems.

## Topics:

1. Scaling Redis

    - Sharding strategies
    - Redis Cluster design patterns

2. Performance tuning

    - Memory optimization
    - Eviction policies (LRU, LFU)
    - Benchmarking with redis-benchmark

3. Security

    - Password authentication
    - TLS/SSL connections
    - ACLs (Access Control Lists)

4. Monitoring & Analytics

    - INFO command for stats
    - Slow log analysis
    - Tools: RedisInsight, Prometheus + Grafana

5. Best practices

    - Key naming conventions
    - Choosing TTLs wisely
    - Avoiding memory fragmentation

Exercises:

- Set up a Redis Cluster locally with multiple nodes
- Configure TLS and ACLs
- Monitor memory and key usage in real-time

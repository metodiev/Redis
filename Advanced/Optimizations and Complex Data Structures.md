# Goal: Dive into advanced Redis features and best practices.

## Topics:

1. Advanced Data Structures

- Sorted Sets for leaderboards
- HyperLogLog for approximate counting
- Bitmaps / Bitfields
- Streams for event queues

2. Persistence & durability

- RDB snapshots vs. AOF logs
- Configuring persistence for reliability

3. Lua Scripting

- Run atomic scripts on Redis
- Complex operations in a single command

4. Cluster and replication

- Master-slave replication
- Redis Sentinel for high availability
- Basic Redis Cluster setup

Exercises:

- Create a real-time leaderboard using Sorted Sets
- Implement a reliable message queue using Redis Streams
- Configure Redis Sentinel for failover

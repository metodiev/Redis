# Goal: Be able to design, optimize, and maintain large-scale Redis systems.

## Topics:

1. Architecting Redis for microservices

    - Cache aside, read-through, write-through patterns
    - Event-driven microservices with Streams and Pub/Sub

2. High-availability & disaster recovery

    - Multi-region Redis deployment
    - Backup strategies

3. Profiling and advanced optimization

    - Memory analysis (MEMORY USAGE, MEMORY STATS)
    - Command latency and slowlog tuning

4. Hybrid setups

    - Redis + PostgreSQL / MongoDB caching strategies

5. Open-source contributions / internal tooling

    - Contributing to Redis modules
    - Writing custom Redis modules

Exercises:

- Build a scalable caching layer for a high-traffic application
- Implement real-time analytics using Redis Streams and Sorted Sets
- Simulate failover and recovery in a multi-node setup
